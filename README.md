# Installation Guide

Go to your vps where the panel is hosted and run
```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MBG1337/McubeTheme/main/install.sh)
 ```
**⚠️ use `sudo su` if you are not root**

`I am not responsible for any issues occured during installations.`
After Executing the script, you would get a UI like this :

To install you need to type 1 and press enter, after that the script it self will install the theme without any further inputs.

**If you encounter an error, re-run the script and type 3 and press enter and it will restore the panel with the panel's old backup created during the installation.**
